The weather data I used was for the local D.C. area and was transformed in a iPython notebook before being stored in a Mongo-DB. The app dynamically scrapes and joins <a href='https://archive.org/details/tv' target='_blank'>local tv news coverage</a> with this dataset. My submission won 3rd place.

Most of the code was done in Java while the statistical pieces used R and included the ability to do chi-squared tests, linear and logistic regressions, Rank Sum Tests and  Kaplan Meier Survival (Cox Hazard Ratio) analysis. Since this was a proprietary application there are no publicly available links.

It combines three Google APIs (directions, maps, and places) to give a user not only a route between two locations but also a filter to see different types of businesses along the way. It could still use some lovin' but was mostly intended to be a fun learning experience.

It uses the Reddit API to show several subreddits at once in a pinterest-type style. By displaying only the title, content, and top comment for each item it allows for a very efficient wasting of time. The number of columns is determined by screen width and any valid subreddit can be entered into a column's respective text box.

Devon did most of the javascript while I handled the design including a responsive mobile version and extensive work learning GPU accelerated transistions.
